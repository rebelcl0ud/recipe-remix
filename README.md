# 🛠️ recipe remix 🚧

A Remix app (manual setup) with basic registration and login functionality, Zod-based form validation, Vitest unit tests, and environment variable setup automation (so far).

---

## 📦 Getting Started

### 1. 📥 Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

---

### 2. 🧪 Setup Environment Variables

Run the script to generate your `.env` file:

```bash
npm run generate-env
```

This will create a `.env` file with the necessary fields like:

```env
SESSION_SECRET="<auto-generated>"
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
```

If a `.env` already exists, it will be skipped. It also creates a `.env.example` if not present.

> ✅ `.env` is already in `.gitignore`.

---

### 3. 🧱 Database Setup

If you're using Prisma + SQLite:

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

To seed data (optional):

```bash
npm run seed
```

---

### 4. 🧪 Run Tests

```bash
npm test
```
